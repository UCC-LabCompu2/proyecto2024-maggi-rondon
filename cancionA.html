                Em                        F#m

                Here comes the story of a hurricane

                       G#m                               F#m

                And no temper's lost like crying tears in rain

                E                            F#m

                No love is lost and no sweet wisdom gained

                   G#m                                   F#m

                So save your tears and save yourself the shame


                       E     F#m

                Cyclone

                          Gm  G#m  Gm   F#m

                You're on your own


                E                                     F#m

                As we left the house and took a step outside

                         G#m                                  F#m

                I could taste in the air a familiar sense of pride

                E                                            F#m

                And the wind it blows you held your head up high

                       G#m                                   F#m

                Then I saw the clouds draw storms into your eyes



                       E     F#m

                Cyclone

                          Gm  G#m  Gm   F#m

                You're on your own

                       E     F#m

                Cyclone

                          Gm  G#m  Gm   F#m

                You're on your own



                E

                He's my man but said I'm breaking bones

                F#m

                Out in the fire won't leave him alone

                       G#m                                F#m

                It was bad and I was unable to pull him inside

                E

                So bring down them bridges


                Dig up them bones

                F#m

                What's that you got cause I'll have one of those

                G#m                                 F#m

                Darcy, I could never hate yah if I tried



                       E     F#m

                Cyclone

                           Gm  G#m  Gm   F#m

                You're on your own

                       E     F#m

                Cyclone

                           Gm  G#m  Gm   F#m

                You're on your own


                        E

                Cyclone
