         F#m         A  B7

        I need to be myself

                  F#m          A  B7

        I can't be no one else

              F#m                A               B7

        I'm feeling supersonic, Give me gin and tonic

        F#m                      A               B7

        You can have it all but how much do you want it?



            F#m            A  B7

        You make me laugh

                       F#m     A  B7

        Give me your autograph

              F#m                   A       B7

        Can I ride with you in your B---M---W?

                F#m                 A          B7

        You can sail with me in my yellow submarine





                     E

        You need to find out

                                             F#m

        'Cos no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about

                     E

        You need to find a way for what you want to say

        C#7

         ...But before tomorrow








             D          A         E       F#m

        'Cuz my friend said he'd take you home

            D         A     E    F#m

        He sits in a corner all alone

        D        A        E   F#m

        He lives under a waterfall

         D          A        E         F#m

        Nobody can see him, Nobody can ever hear him call

         D          A        E         F#m

                            Nobody can ever hear him call



        D A E F#m x3



         E     C#7








                   F#m           A  B7

        You need to be yourself

                    F#m          A  B7

        You can't be no one else

           F#m                           A          B7

        I know a girl called Elsa, She's into Alka-Seltzer

             F#m                           A          B7

        She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train



                F#m            A  B7

        And she makes me laugh

                  F#m       A  B7

        I got her autograph

            F#m                   A        B7

        She done it with a doctor on a helicopter

               F#m                     A              B7

        She's sniffin' in her tissue, Sellin' the Big Issue

        And she finds out

                                        F#m

        No one's gonna tell her what I'm on about
